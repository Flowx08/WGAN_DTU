Deeplearning project on WGAN
============================

TODO
============================
- Implementation of the standard GAN
- Implementation of the WGAN with gradient clipping
- For the choice of the network it is quite free depending on the resources, but please look into DCGAN for guidance.
- WGAN with spectral normalisation
- Results on two dimensional gaussian, MNIST and CIFAR-10 (maybe LSUN if possible, or a subset maybe depending on the computational resource)
- Implementation of FID (maybe IS as well)
- Run multiple experiments with confidence interval
- Understanding of the basic theory behind
