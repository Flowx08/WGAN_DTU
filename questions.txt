- What are we supposed to put on the poster? Anything specific you would like us to include?
Answer: 
A little bit of theory, like showing main formulas. 
Avoid text. 
Show plots, images foumluas etc. 
Maybe a plot of the FID score. 
We can also do this: compare 3 GANS vs 3 Datasets (so 9 plots in total) and show FID score for them all. 





- We are having difficulties with generating good samples from the CIFAR-10 dataset. How good do you expect us to generate from this dataset?
Answer: We don't need perfect results.




- Is it normal to spend 8-10 hours for training on the CIFAR-10 dataset?
Answer: It is normal, but he has a list of things to do to make the time go down. 



- Do the report need to follow a specific layout? And is it correct that the deadline for handin is in january?
Answer:
Add abstract
Introduction of GAN and WGAN
(Maybe) a section where we show what work has been made before and the challenges they faced
Experiment
Conclusion



- Can you help with spectral normalization? would it make our samples better?
Answer:
wrap around linear and conv layers
We can aso use certain types of activbation functions like relu
Leaky relu is maybe not possible
put spectral norm around each layer. meaning we need to write it multiple times.
